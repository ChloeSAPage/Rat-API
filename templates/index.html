<h1>How to use</h1>

<h2>Get Rat Pic</h2>
<p>Firstly, we add to the URL /get-pic-amount. This will return the max number of rat pics currently available</p>
<p>We can use this information to get our rat pic. Now change the URL to include /get-rat/rat-id. Replace rat-id with the number rat you'd like to see. Remember rats under 10 follow this format, 01, 02, 03 etc.</p>
<p>Enjoy your rat!</p>
